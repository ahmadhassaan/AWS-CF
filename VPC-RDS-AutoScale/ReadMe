This Full stack templates will do the following (it is important to create in sequence,otherwise will fail):
Frist File (1-vpc-stack.yaml) to create 
        1-  VPC 
        2- Two Public Subnets.
        3- Two Private Subnets.
        4- Internet Gateway.
        5- Two NAT Gateway,so each Private subnet can access internet.
Second File (2-RDS-MySQL.yaml) to create :
        1- To import values from previuos stack ( VPC ID and the two Private Subnet )
        2- Create MySQL instance of type (db.t2.micro)
        3- Make DB to run in only Private Subnets ( using AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup )
        4- Allow only connection from any service/instance runs within Private Subnet (AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup)
        5- Enable DB available in two zones.
Third File (3-ASG-ApplicationLB - RDS.yaml) to create  :
      1-  Bastion Host in first Public Subnet.
      2- ALB ( Application Load Balancer) that is internet-facing.
      3- AutoScale Group that launches instances within private subnet only and register them with Load Balancer.
      4- a bash script to initialize EC2 instances by installing ( Apache ,PHP ,PHP Native Driver for MySQL).
      5- Also ,bash script will configure DB connection to connect to previous stack ( RDS ).
      6- create index.php (as sample) that will connect to MySQL and list/update one table.
      7- Outputs to tell Load Balancer DNS name and Bastion Host Public IP
